NBA Second Half Total Points Model Test Script

This script:
1. Loads the most recent XGBoost model trained with xg2.py
2. Evaluates performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ², MBE)
3. Analyzes error distribution (how often predictions are within 1, 2, 3 points, etc.)
4. Creates visualizations of the results
5. Analyzes betting win rate for over/under predictions
